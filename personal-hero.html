          Cecilia is my personal hero. She is a smart cute young lady who has
          recently turned 15. She is a person who challenges herself and enjoys
          herself with everything that they do. Cecilia is a great person who
          has become a even better person through friends. The real reson why
          she is my personal hero is because she can inspire me to do good
          things and to make me happy all the time.
