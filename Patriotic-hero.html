          George Washington was a Profound hero that has gathered people to be
          in alliance and he was a commander in chief of the continental army
          during the american revolution and he helped save the world. While the
          American Revolution was happening he led his troop of people through a
          grueling eight years of war and he kep giving them directions and
          motivations so they wouldn't gve up on themselves, and this shows how
          he was able to help and lead men to keep going. During the American
          Revolution George Washington helped and led the colonial forces to
          victory over the British and he became a national hero. After becoming
          a national hero he was then the first U.S president and he helped the
          U.S because he then helped with farming where he had a 8,000 acre
          property with five farms where he grew a variety of crops including
          things from corn and wheat. He then helped and experimented with
          arming and he gave the public methods of farming and new tools to farm
          with.
